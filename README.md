# The Buddy System
Solo project by Stephanie Barker

The Buddy System is a to-do list application with a twist: you can't check off your own list items! Instead, you must share your list with a Buddy, who will check your items off for you. This means that you've got another person holding you accountable, which has always been an important positive factor in building new habits and skills.
